# Introduction
Hi ! I am **Sumit Mundra**.

I have built a lot of backend modules for businesses in social networking, e-commerce and hospitality domain in my last 12 years of experience. In my recent experience with OYO as SDE 3, I led global search platform and guided/reviewed designs for modules across multiple technology orgs in the company. I am looking for a short term project and I am confident that I can help in delivering them with required quality and deadlines as needed.

# Repository
This repo is base for github-pages website built using hugo and [adritian theme](https://themes.gohugo.
io/themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/). Due to some configuration issues at this moment in adding theme as submodules, I 
simply copied the theme content into project root in order to simplify project layout.
