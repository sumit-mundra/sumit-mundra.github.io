# Introduction
Hi ! I am **Sumit Mundra**.

I have built a lot of backend modules for businesses in social networking, e-commerce and hospitality domain in my last 12 years of experience. In my recent experience with OYO as SDE 3, I led global search platform and guided/reviewed designs for modules across multiple technology orgs in the company. I am looking for a short term project and I am confident that I can help in delivering them with required quality and deadlines as needed.
